Capitalize Words
Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new string that
contains the original value of the argument with the first character of every word
capitalized and all other letters lowercase.

You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

Examples

word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'
=end



p word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
p word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
p word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'

Solution
def word_cap(words)
  words_array = words.split.map do |word|
    word.capitalize
  end
  words_array.join(' ')
end
We can also write this more succinctly as:

def word_cap(words)
  words.split.map(&:capitalize).join(' ')
end
Discussion
In the second solution, (&:method_name) is shorthand notation for
{ |item| item.method_name }. Thus, &:capitalize translates to:

do |word|
  word.capitalize
end
We can use this shorthand syntax with any method that has no required arguments.

Further Exploration
Ruby convenient provides the String#capitalize method to capitalize strings.
Without that method, how would you solve this problem? Try to come up with at
least two solutions.
