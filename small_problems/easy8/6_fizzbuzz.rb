fizzbuzz
Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and
the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two numbers,
except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is divisible by
5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Example:

fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz

=end



p fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz

Solution
def fizzbuzz(starting_number, ending_number)
  result = []
  starting_number.upto(ending_number) do |number|
    result << fizzbuzz_value(number)
  end
  puts result.join(', ')
end

def fizzbuzz_value(number)
  case
  when number % 3 == 0 && number % 5 == 0
    'FizzBuzz'
  when number % 5 == 0
    'Buzz'
  when number % 3 == 0
    'Fizz'
  else
    number
  end
end
Discussion
There may be a couple of things that you haven't encountered in this solution.
First, notice that we use a case statement in the fizzbuzz_value method. This
case statement doesn't have a value next to case for comparison. When using a
  case statement in this form, we get the same functionality as if we used an
    if/elsif/else conditional.

Another thing of interest is that there isn't anything other than that case
statement in fizzbuzz_value method. This works because a case statement returns
the value from the last line of the matched when branch. For example, if a number
is divisible only by 3, then 'fizz' is returned from the case statement. That
return value then acts as the return value for the method, since there are
no other lines after this case statement.
