Grade book
Write a method that determines the mean (average) of the three scores passed to
it, and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

Numerical Score Letter	Grade
90 <= score <= 100	'A'
80 <= score < 90	'B'
70 <= score < 80	'C'
60 <= score < 70	'D'
0 <= score < 60	'F'
Tested values are all between 0 and 100. There is no need to check for negative
values or values greater than 100.

Example:

get_grade(95, 90, 93) == "A"
get_grade(50, 50, 95) == "D"

=end



p get_grade(95, 90, 93) == "A"
p get_grade(50, 50, 95) == "D"








=begin

MY SLUSH
def get_grade(first, second, third)
  score = (first + second + third) / 3
  return 'A' if score >= 90
  return 'B' if score >= 80
  return 'C' if score >= 70
  return 'D' if score >= 60
  return 'F' if score < 60
end


Hide Solution & Discussion
Solution
def get_grade(s1, s2, s3)
  result = (s1 + s2 + s3)/3

  case result
  when 90..100 then 'A'
  when 80..89  then 'B'
  when 70..79  then 'C'
  when 60..69  then 'D'
  else              'F'
  end
end
Discussion
The result is just the average of the three scores. The case statement does a
  comparison on it. This takes advantage of the fact that the comparison used by
  the case statement returns true if the range includes the other object
    (essentially calling (range).include?(other_object).

You can therefore read it as

when (90..100).include?(result)
Further exploration
How would you handle this if there was a possibility of extra credit grades
causing it to exceed 100 points?
