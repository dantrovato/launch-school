101-109 - Small ProblemsAdvanced 1Transpose MxN

Transpose MxN
In the previous exercise, you wrote a method to transpose a 3 x 3 matrix as
represented by a ruby Array of Arrays.

Matrix transposes aren't limited to 3 x 3 matrices, or even square matrices. Any
matrix can be transposed by simply switching columns with rows.

Modify your transpose method from the previous exercise so it works with any matrix
with at least 1 row and 1 column.

Examples:

transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4]]) == [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
transpose([[1], [2], [3], [4]]) == [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 7, 8, 6, 2]]) ==
  [[1, 4, 3], [2, 3, 7], [3, 2, 8], [4, 1, 6], [5, 0, 2]]
transpose([[1]]) == [[1]]

[[1, 2, 3, 4]] == [
                  [1]
                  [2]
                  [3]
                  [4]]

[[1],
[2],
[3]] = [[1, 2, 3, 4]]

[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0],
[3, 7, 8, 6, 2]] == [[1, 4, 3],
                    [2, 3, 7],
                    [3, 2, 8],
                    [4, 1, 6],
                    [5, 0, 2]]
=end



p transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4]]) == [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
p transpose([[1], [2], [3], [4]]) == [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
p transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 7, 8, 6, 2]]) ==
  [[1, 4, 3], [2, 3, 7], [3, 2, 8], [4, 1, 6], [5, 0, 2]]
p transpose([[1]]) == [[1]]

MY SLUSH
def transpose(matrix) # => [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
  result = []
  0.upto(matrix[0].size - 1).each do |column_index|
    new_row = 0.upto(matrix.size - 1).map { |row_index| matrix[row_index][column_index] }
    result << new_row
  end
  result
end

Hide Solution & Discussion
Solution
def transpose(matrix)
  result = []
  number_of_rows = matrix.size
  number_of_columns = matrix.first.size
  (0...number_of_columns).each do |column_index|
    new_row = (0...number_of_rows).map { |row_index| matrix[row_index][column_index] }
    result << new_row
  end
  result
end
Discussion
With our previous solution, this exercise boils down to just determining the
correct number of rows and columns in the matrix. The number of rows is easy, and
we can get the number of columns by looking at any row and getting its size (we
  assume that we have a well-formed matrix with rows of equal length). After that,
  we just need to update our loops to use the new results.

Note that we also switch to using the 3 dot (...) form of the range operator so
we don't have to do (number_of_columns - 1) and (number_of_rows - 1).

Further Exploration
Some of you may have been able to solve this exercise without doing a thing; if
you determined your matrix size dynamically in the previous exercise instead of
relying on the 3 x 3 requirement, you solved both problems in one step. However,
almost everybody probably did a strict 3 x 3 solution for the first exercise.

How do you think you would have fared if you had to start with this exercise? How
  much harder would you have found the solution to be if you hadn't encountered
  and solved the 3x3 case first?
