Merge Sort
Sort an array of passed in values using merge sort. You can assume that this array
may contain only one type of data. And that data may be either all numbers or all
strings.

Merge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that works by breaking down the array
elements into nested sub-arrays, then recombining those nested sub-arrays in sorted
order. It is best shown by example. For instance, let's merge sort the array
[9,5,7,1]. Breaking this down into nested sub-arrays, we get:

[9, 5, 7, 1] ->
[[9, 5], [7, 1]] ->
[[[9], [5]], [[7], [1]]]
We then work our way back to a flat array by merging each pair of nested sub-arrays:

[[[9], [5]], [[7], [1]]] ->
[[5, 9], [1, 7]] ->
[1, 5, 7, 9]
Examples:

merge_sort([9, 5, 7, 1]) == [1, 5, 7, 9]
merge_sort([5, 3]) == [3, 5]
merge_sort([6, 2, 7, 1, 4]) == [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
merge_sort(%w(Sue Pete Alice Tyler Rachel Kim Bonnie)) == %w(Alice Bonnie Kim
  Pete Rachel Sue Tyler)
merge_sort([7, 3, 9, 15, 23, 1, 6, 51, 22, 37, 54, 43, 5, 25, 35, 18, 46]) ==
[1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 15, 18, 22, 23, 25, 35, 37, 43, 46, 51, 54]

    end
    result << value
  end
  result.concat(array2[index2..-1])

Hide Solution & Discussion
Approach/Algorithm
Here is a link to some pseudocode and a description of how merge sort works in
more detail.

Feel free to use the merge method you wrote in the previous exercise.

Solution
def merge_sort(array)
  return array if array.size == 1

  sub_array_1 = array[0...array.size / 2]
  sub_array_2 = array[array.size / 2...array.size]

  sub_array_1 = merge_sort(sub_array_1)
  sub_array_2 = merge_sort(sub_array_2)

  merge(sub_array_1, sub_array_2)
end
Discussion
Merge sort is one of the more efficient sorting algorithms. However, because of
its efficiency, it can be a bit difficult to understand (not to say that everything
that is efficient is hard to understand). Let's break this down, step by step.

Our solution uses the merge method from the previous exercise.

Our method takes the array passed in, and turns it into two smaller arrays. If
the size of the original array is even, then we get two even sized arrays. If it
is odd, then sub_array_1 will be odd in size and sub_array_2 will be even. We do
this to break our sorting procedure into smaller, more manageable steps. It
doesn't really matter where you put the extra element in odd-sized arrays, so
long as you put it in one of the two sub-arrays.

After splitting the array into two sub-arrays, we call ourselves recursively,
first on one of the sub-arrays, then on the other. Each of these two calls will
sort the subarray by repeating this process until the trivial case of sorting a
one-element array is encountered; at this point, we just return that array as-is
(it is already sorted).

Once we have the sub-array results, we merge them together using our merge method.
With each merge, we take two small sub-arrays, and return a larger array that
contains all of the elements from both sub-arrays. This repeats at each level until
we reach the top level. At this point, the final sorted array is returned to the
caller.

Further Exploration
Every recursive algorithm can be reworked as a non-recursive algorithm. Can you
write a method that performs a non-recursive merge sort?
